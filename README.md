# Drunk-person-detection
The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drunk detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s is drunk or not. This system will alert the driver when drunk is detected.  
Our product  targets the detection of underage drinking, drug usage, and high levels of intoxication. The severity of these problems has only escalated. For example with regards to underage drinking, 75% of the youth in India consume alcohol before the legal age, and in America, 11% of alcohol consumed is by people between the age of 15 and 20. Our team, being teenagers, can especially sympathize with this problem as on a weekly basis, we are exposed to parties where mass amounts of teenagers overdrink. As a result, in the USA alone, underage drinking causes above 4,300 deaths every year. Thus, to prevent any potential underage inebriation from occurring, we have devised IntelliLens; our product will use Artificial Intelligence Computer Vision to detect if a person is underaged and subsequently make any alarms. With this, we hope to decrease the amount of underage drinking substantially.
